# Gen AI based Data Generator for Researchers and ML engineers 

To solve the Gap of tedious manual image generation to train on single scenario, we provide the AI powered application to automate the whole process and make it a one stop solution for all creation, modification and augmentation needs for a image Data. 
We are keeping it open source so that the Community can utilize its capabilities, in order to Solve Dataset Needs for their ML applications.
The Project Utilizes the Gen-AI capabilities to Generate Data to match real world Scenarios. 
Automating the tedious task of collecting Data and scraping. Agentic Scraping of Data, reflecting explainability over the provided results. eg. Results like Perplexity. 
Integration of Generative capabilities and Augmentation to create versatile databases to cater your research needs.

A FastAPI-based service that generates synthetic image datasets using LangGraph workflow and AI models. This project combines the power of language models and image generation to create customizable datasets for various use cases.

## Features

- Interactive chat-based interface for dataset generation
- Customizable dataset parameters (size, resolution)
- Support for multiple AI models (Groq, OpenAI)
- Session management for maintaining context
- Sample image preview before full dataset generation
- RESTful API endpoints for integration

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Groq API key
- OpenAI API key
- Flask For backend API
- Python libraries = langgraph langsmith langchain langchain_groq langchain_community langchain_openai FastAPI uvicorn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi langchain langgraph langchain_groq langchain_openai python-dotenv
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /chat

Chat with the UI 
- Chat with the conversation Agent to seamlessly get preffered responses.
- You can Ask for sample images, review and fine tune the diversity of generated prompts which acts as the basis of the dataset.
- The Full Image Dataset Zip file will be Provided to the User once he is satisfied with sample images, prompts and is ready to get Full Dataset.

Process user messages and generate responses/images.
```json
{
    "message": "Generate images of mountains",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
}
```

### POST /set_dataset_parameters
Customize dataset generation parameters.
```json
{
    "num_images": 50,
    "resolution": "256x256",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
}
```

### POST /set_api_keys
Set custom API keys for external services.
```json
{
    "groq_api_key": "your_groq_api_key",
    "openai_api_key": "your_openai_api_key",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
}
```

### GET /sessions/{session_id}
Retrieve session information and status.

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

2. Set up your API keys using the `/set_api_keys` endpoint

3. Start a conversation by sending a message to the `/chat` endpoint

4. Customize dataset parameters using `/set_dataset_parameters` if needed

5. Monitor session status and retrieve generated images through the session endpoint

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: FastAPI application and API endpoints
- `Dependancies.py`: Core functionality for image generation workflow
- `FS_BackendTesting.ipynb`: Development and testing notebook


# Git Commands Usage in the Repository

## 1. Initializing the Repository (`git init`)
When the repository was first created, we used `git init` to initialize it locally. This command set up the `.git` directory, which contains all the metadata and version history of the project. For example:
```bash
git init
```
This ensured the repository was ready to track changes and collaborate.

---

## 2. Staging Changes (`git add`)
During development, we staged files before committing them. For instance, when we made changes to core scripts like `main.py` or updated the README file, we ran:
```bash
git add main.py README.md
```
This placed the files into the staging area, marking them ready for a commit.

---

## 3. Committing Changes (`git commit`)
After staging the files, we recorded snapshots of the repository by committing them. Here's an example of a commit message we might have used:
```bash
git commit -m "Add main.py and update README with project details"
```
This created a checkpoint in the repository's history.

---

## 4. Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository (`git push`)
To share changes with collaborators, we pushed commits to the remote repository, hosted on GitHub. For example:
```bash
git push origin main
```
This command uploaded our local `main` branch to the remote repository, ensuring others could access the latest updates.

---

## 5. Pulling Updates from the Remote Repository (`git pull`)
To keep our local repository in sync with the remote, we often pulled updates made by other contributors. For example:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This fetched the latest changes from the `main` branch and merged them into our local branch.

---

## 6. Managing Branches (`git branch`)
We created and switched between branches to work on different features or fixes. For instance:
```bash
git branch feature/new-feature
git checkout feature/new-feature
```
This created a new branch called `feature/new-feature` and switched to it. After finishing the work, we merged it back into the `main` branch.

---

## 7. Cloning the Repository (`git clone`)
For new developers joining the project, cloning the repository was the first step. They ran:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chainSAW-crypto/chainSAW-crypto.git
```
This copied all the files, branches, and commit history to their local machine.

---

## Example Workflow
Hereâ€™s an example of how we might have used these commands in sequence:
1. **Start a New Feature**:
    ```bash
    git branch feature/add-authentication
    git checkout feature/add-authentication
    ```
2. **Make Changes and Stage Them**:
    ```bash
    git add auth.py
    ```
3. **Commit the Changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Implement user authentication module"
    ```
4. **Push the Feature Branch for Collaboration**:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-authentication
    ```
5. **Merge the Feature into Main**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature/add-authentication
    git push origin main
    ```

This tailored explanation demonstrates how these commands might have been actively used in the development of this repository.
